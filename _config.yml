description: "A passionate maker at the intersection of creativity and technology. My journey began with a Bachelor of Arts in Music Arts Technology from Bloomfield College, NJ (now part of Montclair University), followed by a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (MSEE) with a focus on Audio Technology from the University of Rochester. These foundational experiences honed my skills in everything from fundamental audio engineering to advanced Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts. After my studies, my biggest adventure truly began when I founded and led Adventure Audio. It was a passion project, a journey of innovation where I poured my heart into creating unique audio equipment for musicians and audiophiles. This venture operated on both Business-to-Consumer (B2C) and Business-to-Business (B2B) models. The B2B operations included stocking retailers with our innovative products and manufacturing custom enclosures for third-party vendors, some of whom were larger enterprises. This entrepreneurial experience served as a crucible for developing a diverse skill set, including: Manufacturing & Operations: CNC machining, UV printing, powder coating, 3D printing, pick-and-place programming and operation, screen printing, electrical test assemblies and processes. I mastered the entire product lifecycle, from Design for Manufacturability (DFM) to navigating international shipping trades. Business Management: Component sourcing, database management, payroll, business taxes and laws, employee management, financial operations, leadership, and human resources. This provided a deep understanding of both the technical and operational facets of running a successful manufacturing business. Web & Creative Development: Website and webshop creation and maintenance, illustrative design, social media engagement (growing several channels), photo and video editing, and shooting promotional and tutorial videos. Core Audio Technology: Designing PCBs, rigorously testing and simulating circuits, and meticulously crafting product enclosures with intuitive UI/UX. This holistic approach ensured our unique audio equipment was exceptional from concept to user experience. Unfortunately, the immense challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic forced the difficult decision to close Adventure Audio. This pivotal moment ultimately led to my transition into the role of a Technology Development Scientist. More recently, I had been working as a Technology Development Scientist for a private company, where I was at the forefront of developing advanced X-ray and photon imaging technology and cameras for X-ray experiments at synchotron particle accelerators. This role was a deep dive into cutting-edge science and engineering, where I gained extensive experience in: Advanced PCB Design: Utilizing industry-standard tools like Altium and OrCAD for complex circuit board layouts. Scientific Grant Writing: Successfully securing research funding, including for projects with the Department of Energy (DOE). Materials Science & Physics: Investigating electrical and chemical interactions, X-ray and synchrotron science, GaN (Gallium Nitride) technology, and understanding lattice structures and band gaps. Microfabrication & Experimentation: Developing lithography and patterning techniques for wafers, and conducting vacuum chamber experiments to test multiple material resonances with custom CMOS sensors. Data Acquisition & Control: Gaining proficiency with fiber optic connections and communications, managing Linux servers, terminals, and CLIs, and developing custom Python scripting for various electrical measurement equipment. Notably, I created custom Python analysis scripts to meticulously analyze the accuracy of the X-ray detectors the company manufactured. This analysis, often performed during experiments at prestigious institutions like Cornell University, specifically at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). These experiments involved using multiple material samples to conduct linearity measurements for the X-ray detector cameras. This process required manually triggering sampling windows with the particle accelerator to accurately capture the data. For instance, a CeO2 sample was used to capture diffraction rings for precise geolocation calibration of multiple sensors within the camera, while a ruby sample was employed to measure intensities over multiple integration and interframe steps to generate a comprehensive linearity response chart, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in X-ray science. Due to recent shifts in scientific research funding, I'm currently seeking a new adventure! I'm actively honing my skills in Python, exploring self-hosted open-source software for various applications, and diving deep into large language model implementation for audio technology development. Services include Sound Design, Technical Writing, Audio Engineering, and Engineering Design. Associated with Sydor Technologies and the University of Rochester.
