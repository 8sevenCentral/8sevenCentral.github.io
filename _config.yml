description: "Hey there! I'm Christian, a passionate maker who loves bringing ideas to life at the exciting crossroads of creativity and technology. I'm actively seeking new collaborations and exciting projects, and I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts. Here are some of the things I've done so far: My journey began with a Bachelor of Arts in Music Arts Technology from Bloomfield College, NJ (now part of Montclair University), followed by a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (MSEE) with a focus on Audio Technology from the University of Rochester. These foundational experiences honed my skills in everything from fundamental audio engineering to advanced Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts. After my studies, my biggest adventure truly began when I founded and led Adventure Audio. It was a passion project, a journey of innovation where I poured my heart into creating unique audio equipment for musicians and audiophiles. This venture operated on both Business-to-Consumer (B2C) and Business-to-Business (B2B) models. The B2B operations included stocking retailers with our innovative products and manufacturing custom enclosures for third-party vendors, some of whom were larger than us. This entrepreneurial experience served as a crucible for developing a diverse skill set, including: Manufacturing & Operations: CNC machining, UV printing, powder coating, 3D printing, pick-and-place programming and operation, screen printing, electrical test assemblies and processes. I mastered the entire product lifecycle, from Design for Manufacturability (DFM), ensuring our concepts translated seamlessly into production, to navigating the complexities of international shipping trades. My responsibilities extended to meticulous component sourcing, establishing robust database management systems, and handling all aspects of financial operations, including payroll, business taxes and laws, and employee management. I also had the privilege of developing strong leadership and human resources skills, fostering a collaborative environment and guiding a talented team. Beyond the core business operations, my role expanded to encompass a diverse set of technical and creative responsibilities. I became proficient in website and webshop creation and maintenance, showcasing my web development skills, and honed my abilities in illustrative design. I also developed a keen eye for social media engagement, growing several channels, and mastering photo and video editing, alongside shooting compelling promotional and tutorial videos. Concurrently, I mastered the core audio technology essential for our products, which involved the intricate process of designing PCBs, rigorously testing and simulating circuits, and meticulously crafting product enclosures with intuitive UI/UX. This holistic approach ensured our unique audio equipment was exceptional from concept to user experience. Unfortunately, the challenges brought on by COVID-19 pandemic forced us to make the tough decision to close up shop, which ultimately led to my transition into the exciting role of a Technology Development Scientist. More recently, I had been working as a Technology Development Scientist for a private company, where I was at the forefront of developing advanced X-ray and photon imaging technology and cameras for X-ray experiments at synchotron particle accelerators. You can see some of the X-ray detectors I worked on here: [Sydor Technologies X-ray Cameras & Detectors](https://sydortechnologies.com/x-ray-cameras-detectors/). This role was a deep dive into cutting-edge science and engineering, where I gained extensive experience in: Advanced PCB Design: Utilizing industry-standard tools like Altium and OrCAD for complex circuit board layouts. Scientific Grant Writing: Successfully securing research funding, including for projects with the Department of Energy (DOE). Materials Science & Physics: Investigating electrical and chemical interactions, X-ray and synchrotron science, GaN (Gallium Nitride) technology, and understanding lattice structures and band gaps. Microfabrication & Experimentation: Developing lithography and patterning techniques for wafers, and conducting vacuum chamber experiments to test multiple material resonances with custom CMOS sensors. Data Acquisition & Control: Gaining proficiency with fiber optic connections and communications, managing Linux servers, terminals, and CLIs, and developing custom Python scripting for various electrical measurement equipment. Notably, I created custom Python analysis scripts to meticulously analyze the accuracy of the X-ray detectors the company manufactured. This analysis, often performed during experiments at prestigious institutions like Cornell University, specifically at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). These experiments involved using multiple material samples to conduct linearity measurements for the X-ray detector cameras. This process required manually triggering sampling windows with the particle accelerator to accurately capture the data. For instance, a CeO2 sample was used to capture diffraction rings for precise geolocation calibration of multiple sensors within the camera, while a ruby sample was employed to measure intensities over multiple integration and interframe steps to generate a comprehensive linearity response chart, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in X-ray science. Due to recent shifts in scientific research funding, I'm currently seeking a new adventure! I'm actively honing my skills in Python, exploring self-hosted open-source software for various applications, and diving deep into large language model implementation for audio technology development. Services include Sound Design, Technical Writing, Audio Engineering, and Engineering Design. Associated with Sydor Technologies and the University of Rochester.
