description: "Hey there! I'm Christian, a passionate maker who loves bringing ideas to life at the exciting crossroads of creativity and technology. I'm actively seeking new collaborations and exciting projects, and I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts. Here are some of the things I've done so far: My journey began with a Bachelor of Arts in Music Arts Technology from Bloomfield College, NJ (now part of Montclair University), followed by a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (MSEE) with a focus on Audio Technology from the University of Rochester. These foundational experiences honed my skills in everything from fundamental audio engineering to advanced Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts. After my studies, my biggest adventure truly began when I founded and led Adventure Audio. It was a passion project, a journey of innovation where I poured my heart into creating unique audio equipment for musicians and audiophiles. This venture operated on both Business-to-Consumer (B2C) and Business-to-Business (B2B) models. The B2B operations included stocking retailers with our innovative products and manufacturing custom enclosures for third-party vendors, some of whom were larger than us. This entrepreneurial experience served as a crucible for developing a diverse skill set, including: Manufacturing & Operations: CNC machining, UV printing, powder coating, 3D printing, pick-and-place programming and operation, screen printing, electrical test assemblies and processes. I mastered the entire product lifecycle, from Design for Manufacturability (DFM), ensuring our concepts translated seamlessly into production, to navigating the complexities of international shipping trades. My responsibilities extended to meticulous component sourcing, establishing robust database management systems, and handling all aspects of financial operations, including payroll, business taxes and laws, and employee management. I also had the privilege of developing stron... [truncated]
