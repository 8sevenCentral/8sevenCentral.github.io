description: "A passionate maker at the intersection of creativity and technology. My journey began with a Bachelor of Arts in Music Arts Technology from Bloomfield College, NJ (now part of Montclair University), followed by a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (MSEE) with a focus on Audio Technology from the University of Rochester. These foundational experiences honed my skills in everything from fundamental audio engineering to advanced Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts. After my studies, my biggest adventure truly began when I founded and led Adventure Audio. It was a passion project, a journey of innovation where I poured my heart into creating unique audio equipment for musicians and audiophiles. My passion for creation extended into the technical heart of our products. I became proficient in designing PCBs, rigorously testing and simulating circuits, and meticulously crafting product enclosures with intuitive UI/UX. This holistic approach ensured our unique audio equipment was exceptional from concept to user experience. To fuel this dream, I successfully applied for and received multiple small business grants, alongside a few successful open-source funding campaigns. These crucial funds allowed us to acquire essential manufacturing machinery, including a used Roland UV printer, which we proudly sourced from none other than Robert Keeley of Keeley Effects. This venture operated on both Business-to-Consumer (B2C) and Business-to-Business (B2B) models. On the B2B side, we had two distinct operations: stocking retailers with our innovative products and manufacturing custom enclosures for third-party vendors, some of whom were larger than us. This entrepreneurial experience served as a crucible for self-taught skills, encompassing everything from hands-on manufacturing processes like CNC machining, UV printing, powder coating, 3D printing, pick-and-place programming and operation, and screen printing, to the intricate details of electrical test assemblies and processes. I mastered the entire product lifecycle, from Design for Manufacturability (DFM), ensuring our concepts translated seamlessly into production, to navigating the complexities of international shipping trades. My responsibilities extended to meticulous component sourcing, establishing robust database management systems, and handling all aspects of financial operations, including payroll, business taxes, and legal compliance. I also had the privilege of developing strong leadership and human resources skills, fostering a collaborative environment and guiding a talented team. Beyond the core business operations, my role expanded to encompass a diverse set of technical and creative responsibilities. I became proficient in website and webshop creation and maintenance, showcasing my web development skills, and honed my abilities in illustrative design. I also developed a keen eye for social media engagement, growing several channels, and mastering photo and video editing, and shooting compelling promotional and tutorial videos. Unfortunately, the immense challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic forced the difficult decision to close Adventure Audio. This pivotal moment ultimately led to my transition into the role of a Technology Development Scientist. More recently, I had been working as a Technology Development Scientist for a private company, where I was at the forefront of developing advanced X-ray and photon imaging technology and cameras for X-ray experiments at synchotron particle accelerators. I've even had the opportunity to run experiments at Cornell University. Due to recent shifts in scientific research funding, I'm currently seeking a new adventure! I'm actively honing my skills in Python, exploring self-hosted open-source software for various applications, and diving deep into large language model implementation for audio technology development. Services include Sound Design, Technical Writing, Audio Engineering, and Engineering Design. Associated with Sydor Technologies and the University of Rochester.
