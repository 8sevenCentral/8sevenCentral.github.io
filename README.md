## Hi, I'm Christian aka 8sevenC! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me

Hey there! I'm Christian, a passionate maker who loves bringing ideas to life at the exciting crossroads of creativity and technology. I'm actively seeking new collaborations and exciting projects, and I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts. Here are some of the things I've done so far:

### Adventure Audio

#### A Symphony of Innovation and Entrepreneurship
My biggest adventure truly began when I founded and led Adventure Audio. It was a passion project, a journey of innovation where I poured my heart into creating unique audio equipment for musicians and audiophiles. We weren't just building products; we were crafting experiences, pushing the boundaries of sound, and connecting with a vibrant community of artists and enthusiasts.

#### The Nuts and Bolts: From Concept to Market
This venture operated on both **Business-to-Consumer (B2C)** and **Business-to-Business (B2B)** models. On the B2B side, we had two distinct operations: stocking retailers with our innovative products and manufacturing custom enclosures for third-party vendors, some of whom were larger than us. This required a deep dive into the entire product lifecycle, from Design for Manufacturability (DFM) â€“ ensuring our concepts translated seamlessly into production â€“ to navigating the complexities of international shipping trades. My responsibilities extended to meticulous component sourcing, establishing robust database management systems, and handling all aspects of financial operations, including payroll, business taxes, and legal compliance. I also developed strong leadership and human resources skills, fostering a collaborative environment and guiding a talented team. Beyond the core business operations, my role expanded to encompass a diverse set of technical and creative responsibilities. I became proficient in website and webshop creation and maintenance, showcasing my web development skills, and honed my abilities in illustrative design. I also developed a keen eye for social media engagement, growing several channels, and mastering photo and video editing, alongside shooting compelling promotional and tutorial videos. Concurrently, I mastered the core audio technology essential for our products, which involved the intricate process of designing PCBs, rigorously testing and simulating circuits, and meticulously crafting product enclosures with intuitive UI/UX. This holistic approach ensured our unique audio equipment was exceptional from concept to user experience.

#### The Unforeseen Encore: A New Scientific Chapter
Unfortunately, the world had other plans. The immense challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic forced us to make the tough decision to close up shop. This pivotal moment, though difficult, ultimately led to my transition into the exciting role of a Technology Development Scientist. It was a new stage, a different kind of innovation, but with the same passion for pushing boundaries. You can still check out our journey and the cool gear we made on Instagram: [instagram.com/adventure_audio](https://instagram.com/adventure_audio).

### Scientific Endeavors
More recently, I've been working as a Technology Development Scientist for a private company, where I've been at the forefront of developing advanced X-ray and photon imaging technology and cameras for X-ray experiments at synchotron particle accelerators. I've even had the opportunity to run experiments at Cornell University.

### New Horizons
Due to recent shifts in scientific research funding, I'm currently seeking a new adventure! I'm actively honing my skills in Python, exploring self-hosted open-source software for various applications, and diving deep into large language model implementation for audio technology development. I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts and collaborate on projects that push boundaries!

### Education
My journey began with a Bachelor of Arts in Music Arts Technology from Bloomfield College, NJ (now part of Montclair University), followed by a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (MSEE) with a focus on Audio Technology from the University of Rochester. These foundational experiences honed my skills in everything from fundamental audio engineering to advanced Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts.
