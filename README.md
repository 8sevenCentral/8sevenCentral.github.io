### üé∂ üéõÔ∏è Adventure Audio: Entrepreneurship and Innovation
Check out our journey on Instagram: [instagram.com/adventure_audio](https://instagram.com/adventure_audio).

#### The Heart of the Sound: Core Audio Technologies
My passion for creation extended into the technical heart of our products. I became proficient in designing PCBs, rigorously testing and simulating circuits, and meticulously crafting product enclosures with intuitive UI/UX. This holistic approach ensured our unique audio equipment was exceptional from concept to user experience.

#### The Journey & The Craft
My biggest adventure truly began when I founded and led Adventure Audio. It was a passion project, a journey of innovation where I poured my heart into creating unique audio equipment for musicians and audiophiles. We weren't just building products; we were crafting experiences, pushing the boundaries of sound, and connecting with a vibrant community of artists and enthusiasts. To fuel this dream, I successfully applied for and received multiple small business grants, alongside a few successful open-source funding campaigns. These crucial funds allowed us to acquire essential manufacturing machinery, including a used Roland UV printer, which we proudly sourced from none other than Robert Keeley of [Keeley Electronics](https://www.keeleyelectronics.com). This venture operated on both Business-to-Consumer (B2C) and Business-to-Business (B2B) models. On the B2B side, we had two distinct operations: stocking retailers with our innovative products and manufacturing custom enclosures for third-party vendors, some of whom were larger than us. This entrepreneurial experience served as a crucible for self-taught skills, encompassing:
*   **Hands-on Manufacturing Processes:** CNC Machining, UV Printing, Powder Coating, 3D Printing, Pick-and-Place Programming and Operation, Screen Printing.
*   **Electrical Test Assemblies & Processes:** Mastering intricate details for quality assurance.
*   **Product Lifecycle Management:** From Design for Manufacturability (DFM) to navigating international shipping trades.
My responsibilities extended to meticulous component sourcing, establishing robust database management systems, and handling all aspects of financial operations, including payroll, business taxes, and legal compliance. I also developed strong leadership and human resources skills, fostering a collaborative environment and guiding a talented team. Beyond the core business operations, my role expanded to encompass a diverse set of technical and creative responsibilities. I became proficient in website and webshop creation and maintenance, showcasing my web development skills, and honed my abilities in illustrative design. I also developed a keen eye for social media engagement, growing several channels, and mastering photo and video editing, alongside shooting compelling promotional and tutorial videos.

Adventure Audio also took me backstage with bands interested in trying our products in solo sessions, including [My Chemical Romance](https://www.mychemicalromance.com), [Circa Survive](https://circasurvive.com), [Relient K](https://www.relientk.com), [Four Year Strong](https://www.fouryearstrong.com), [Anti-Flag](https://www.anti-flag.com), and others.

#### The Unforeseen Encore: A New Scientific Chapter
Unfortunately, the world had other plans. The immense challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic forced us to make the tough decision to close up shop. This pivotal moment, though difficult, ultimately led to my transition into the exciting role of a Technology Development Scientist. It was a new stage, a different kind of innovation, but with the same passion for pushing boundaries. You can still check out our journey and the cool gear we made on Instagram: [instagram.com/adventure_audio](https://instagram.com/adventure_audio).

### üî¨ Scientific Endeavors: Pioneering X-ray and Photon Technologies
More recently, I had been working as a Technology Development Scientist for a private company, where I was at the forefront of developing advanced X-ray and photon imaging technology and cameras for X-ray experiments at synchotron particle accelerators. You can see some of the X-ray detectors I worked on here: [X-ray Cameras & Detectors](https://sydortechnologies.com/x-ray-cameras-detectors/). This role was a deep dive into cutting-edge science and engineering, where I gained extensive experience in:
*   **Advanced PCB Design:** Expertise in multi-layer mixed-signal SMD PCB design, encompassing strategic PCB material selection, optimized layer stackup, robust via stitching techniques, signal integrity (SI) routing methodologies, and meticulous test point placement considerations for Device Under Test (DUT) validation. Proficient in industry-standard tools like Altium and OrCAD for complex circuit board layouts.
*   **Scientific Grant Writing:** Successfully securing research funding, including for projects with the Department of Energy (DOE).
*   **Materials Science & Physics:** Investigating electrical and chemical interactions, X-ray and synchrotron science, GaN (Gallium Nitride) technology, and understanding lattice structures and band gaps.
*   **Microfabrication & Experimentation:** Developing lithography and patterning techniques for wafers, and conducting vacuum chamber experiments to test multiple material resonances with custom CMOS sensors.
*   **Data Acquisition & Communication:** Gaining proficiency with fiber optic connections and communications.
*   **Control Systems & Scripting:** Managing Linux servers, terminals, and CLIs, and developing custom Python scripting for various electrical measurement equipment.
I even had the opportunity to run experiments at prestigious institutions like [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), specifically at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source ([CHESS](https://www.chess.cornell.edu/)). These experiments involved using multiple material samples to conduct linearity measurements for the X-ray detector cameras. This process required manually triggering sampling windows with the particle accelerator to accurately capture the data. For instance, a CeO2 sample was used to capture diffraction rings for precise geolocation calibration of multiple sensors within the camera, while a ruby sample was employed to measure intensities over multiple integration and interframe steps to generate a comprehensive linearity response chart, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in X-ray science.

I closely collaborated with scientists at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) and the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/), as well as interacting with National Labs like [Los Alamos](https://www.lanl.gov/), [Lawrence Livermore](https://www.llnl.gov/), [Brookhaven](https://www.bnl.gov/), and even [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/). Additionally, I collaborated with the [RIT NanoFab](https://www.rit.edu/microsystems/rit-nanofab) for custom fabrication of a GaN device.

### üî≠ New Horizons
Due to recent shifts in scientific research funding, I'm currently seeking a new adventure! I'm actively honing my skills in Python, exploring self-hosted open-source software for various applications, and diving deep into large language model implementation for audio technology development. I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts and collaborate on projects that push boundaries!

### üöÄ A New Beginning: 8sevenC
I am starting a new company called 8sevenC that will strive towards the same goal that Adventure Audio did: create tools for musicians and audiophiles. Though this time I do not want to be limited to pedals and eurorack modules. Yes, I will definitely be designing both of those, but I also have aspirations for designing audio plugins and have a daily growing curiosity about AI and LLMs. I am unsure what the future holds, but in the background, I have been secretly building prototypes and creating a sort of 'digital garden' of my notes over the last few years. These notes are a compilation of random thoughts and extremely technical documents for things like electronics, audio, computer science, and metaphysical research. I am currently building a website ([www.8sevenC.xyz](https://www.8sevenC.xyz)) that will showcase these prototypes as well as my garden.
