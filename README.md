## Hi, I'm Christian aka 8sevenC! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me

Hey there! I'm Christian, a passionate maker who loves bringing ideas to life at the exciting crossroads of creativity and technology.

### Educational Background
My journey began with a Bachelor of Arts in Music Arts Technology from Bloomfield College, NJ (now part of Montclair University), followed by a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (MSEE) with a focus on Audio Technology from the University of Rochester. These foundational experiences honed my skills in everything from fundamental audio engineering to advanced Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts.

### Adventure Audio
My biggest adventure so far was founding and leading Adventure Audio. It was a journey of innovation, where I poured my passion into creating unique audio equipment for musicians and audiophiles. Unfortunately, the challenges brought on by COVID-19 forced us to close up shop, which ultimately led to my transition into the role of a Technology Development Scientist.

### Scientific Endeavors
More recently, I've been working as a Technology Development Scientist for a private company, where I've been at the forefront of developing advanced X-ray and photon imaging technology and cameras for X-ray experiments at synchotron particle accelerators. I've even had the opportunity to run experiments at Cornell University.

### New Horizons
Due to recent shifts in scientific research funding, I'm currently seeking a new adventure! I'm actively honing my skills in Python, exploring self-hosted open-source software for various applications, and diving deep into large language model implementation for audio technology development. I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts and collaborate on projects that push boundaries!
