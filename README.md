## Hi, I'm Christian aka 8sevenC! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me

Hey there! I'm Christian, a passionate maker who loves bringing ideas to life at the exciting crossroads of creativity and technology.

### Educational Background
My journey began with a Bachelor of Arts in Music Arts Technology from Bloomfield College, NJ (now part of Montclair University), followed by a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (MSEE) with a focus on Audio Technology from the University of Rochester. These foundational experiences honed my skills in everything from fundamental audio engineering to advanced Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts.

### Adventure Audio
My biggest adventure so far was founding and leading Adventure Audio. It was a journey of innovation, where I poured my passion into creating unique audio equipment for musicians and audiophiles. This venture became a crucible for self-taught skills, encompassing everything from hands-on manufacturing processes like CNC machining, UV printing, powder coating, 3D printing, pick-and-place programming and operation, and screen printing, to the intricate details of electrical test assemblies and processes. I mastered the entire product lifecycle, from **Design for Manufacturability (DFM)**, ensuring our concepts translated seamlessly into production, to navigating the complexities of **international shipping trades**. My responsibilities extended to meticulous **component sourcing**, establishing robust **database management** systems, and handling all aspects of **financial operations**, including payroll, business taxes, and legal compliance. I also developed strong **leadership and human resources skills** through effective employee management. This comprehensive experience provided a deep understanding of both the technical and operational facets of running a successful manufacturing business. Beyond the business operations, my passion for creation extended into the technical heart of our products. I became proficient in website and webshop creation and maintenance, honed my skills in illustrative design, and, most importantly, mastered the core audio technology. This included the intricate process of designing PCBs, rigorously testing and simulating circuits, and meticulously crafting product enclosures with intuitive UI/UX. This holistic approach ensured our unique audio equipment was exceptional from concept to user experience. Unfortunately, the challenges brought on by COVID-19 forced us to close up shop, which ultimately led to my transition into the role of a Technology Development Scientist.

### Scientific Endeavors
More recently, I've been working as a Technology Development Scientist for a private company, where I've been at the forefront of developing advanced X-ray and photon imaging technology and cameras for X-ray experiments at synchotron particle accelerators. I've even had the opportunity to run experiments at Cornell University.

### New Horizons
Due to recent shifts in scientific research funding, I'm currently seeking a new adventure! I'm actively honing my skills in Python, exploring self-hosted open-source software for various applications, and diving deep into large language model implementation for audio technology development. I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts and collaborate on projects that push boundaries!
